Problem Statement:
Design a message display application. Allow users to enter their name and favorite saying in a single method that gets invoked two times.
First call the method asking for the person’s name. Send a string argument indicating what value should be entered. 
Invoke the method a second time to retrieve the favorite saying. 
Return the string values back to the Main( ) method. Call another method, sending the name and saying.
From that method, display the message showing the person’s name and their saying surrounded by rows of greater than/less than symbols(<><><>).
